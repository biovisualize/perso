Was originally added to autopopulate the geojoin with a ""self join"" for backend choropleth. Now that self joins are no longer necessary to just render the geo data, the actions and reducers are not being used. Leaving the code in place for now since we might want to use it later if we add joins across the product. Worth discussing after 4.0.

> So Eric has pulled the KML & KMZ versions of the NYC building footprints dataset, and neither of them will load. The underlying LibKML parser fails with an out-of-memory error. Not even a GDAL problem. ogrinfo command-line tool reports the same, so it's nothing we are provoking. It's a big KML (1.1GB) but looks fine in a text editor. All the other versions of that data set load fine, as do other smaller KMLs I have. LibKML on my system is an Ubuntu lib, as is GDAL itself (although I have my own build of GDAL 2.3 using the same LibKML). LibKML code is from Google but old (not touched for five years) and the Ubuntu version seems to be up-to-date. Thoughts?
> 
> I have proven that the problem is in LibKML itself, and shows up even with my own build of that and a simple test program to just try and open the file. Turns out there are two KML ""drivers"" in GDAL, and if you configure GDAL to use the other one instead (which you can do even in the MapD context just by setting an env var) then the other one loads it, but drops all the extended fields from the file, so you only get the name and the geo for each feature.
> 
> I think we can justifiably ignore this one as there's a workaround, even if not a very good one, and IMHO, anyone who creates a 1.1GB KML file wants their brain examining along with those who create similarly large GeoJSONs...
> 
> For completeness, the LibKML one is falling over in the basic XML parse (using the Expat lib, presumably from the Ubuntu apt DSO install of such)
> 
> LibKML attempts to read in the entire document and gets Expat to parse the whole thing in one go. This is stupid, as Expat is explicitly written to support streaming and parsing of such files in chunks.

Auto Populate Longitude and Latitude on the map charts,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4615,329243309,4615,,2018-06-04T22:48:06Z,2018-06-04T22:48:06Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description


For the charts that use longitude and latitude, we should see if we could auto-populate these fields for the user.  Example if the data column is title Longitude or Long, we could populate either of these in the longitude and same for latitude. 

In the use cases where the data has multiple longitudes and latitudes columns, we could offer a drop menu asking which one they would like to use. An example in the flights_123M data, there are two sets. dest_lat/dest_lon and origin_lat/orgin_log. The drop menu could be as simple as **dest** and **origin**, and based on the user's selection we populate the correct longitude and latitude fields. 


.........
Some difficulties that we will have:
- if the user titles the longitude and latitude something that is unrecognizable.   
- possibly when we are trying to identify if the Geo data has points versus longitude/latitude.

When a user has a dashboard open and they zoom to a particular area this is treated as a filter. The problem is we don't show it as a filter in the cross filter section thus the user doesn't have a way to clear such filter. 

To make things worse, if the user had zoomed/or moved to an area that doesn't have data, this zeros out the rest of their charts in that dashboard. This can lead to a lot of confusion when the user doesn't realize what chart has the filter thus we should always place a clearable filter at the top filter area like we do with other filters. 



Desired behavior would be to either return the user their previous zoom state that had data or to a zoom to all data state (meaning the zoomed map would show to the size or where any data points exist).

Address confusion around filtering and zooming. ,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4613,329235505,4613,,2018-06-04T22:12:53Z,2018-06-04T22:40:40Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

Users have different intentions at different times.  Sometimes the user is intending on cross filtering based on a particular location(s) or based on a particular date/time range. 

Other times their intentions are to change their view to move around or to zoom in particular data in a map or move around to see data over different dates. 

The current behavior is to treat zooming as a filter (kind of).  This causes a lot of confusion and in some cases could render a dashboard useless without giving the user any idea why they are no longer seeing any data. 

One suggestion is to make an implicit request from the user to know their intent. Another is to use a different type of controls.

However, we offer these enhancements we need to give users the ability to both in an intuitive way.



>>>>>
One quick win that we could do is place a clearable filter pill anytime we are treating the zoom as a filter.

All government accounts require apps to be accessible. With the IQT work starting to take priority I would like to get in front of this issue before we are rushed into it.   Making apps both accessible and visually appealing can be a difficult challenge. If we wait until the last minute we will inevitably be forced to rush design changes that never look good. As a result, I would like to start to do some design cycles on this as soon as possible.




Some obvious changes:
- Change button color. The current light teal button color doesn't offer enough contrast.
- Change the light gray background areas to be dark enough to create passing contrast.
- Place tooltips on all icons
- Possibly offer alternative CSS to allow user control over text size, and additional contrast, etc.
- Test current font size, weight, and shades throughout the app.
- Continued work on default minimum size on charting elements. 
- Add points to things like line charts to make it easier to locate where the hover is.
- Improve zoom controls
- more to come.

As gravy we should probably at least slot in # Records as the measure so it renders straight away. A better thing would not to require a measure at all for rendering a poly table, and the user could just pick the static color of each poly (like most GIS systems work).

Currently there are no zooming limitations for the Scatter chart, allowing the user to zoom out to measurements where the points are impossible to see or zoom in so far that the user could drag and drop forever and not encounter a single point. The scatter map can be reset by removing the filter, but it would be nice if there was some limitation even if the user decides to use this chart incorrectly. 

The infinite zoom also causes errors in the console and will actually hang immerse with certain datasets and measurements while the zooming in/out past a reasonable measure.

Enhance file upload to use chunking instead of multi part POST request ,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4563,328254891,4563,,2018-05-31T18:48:57Z,2018-05-31T18:48:57Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
Currently the file uploader has a nice progress bar that gives feedback to the user, however it uses a multipart POST request that holds a single request open waiting for a response. The implications of this are that if there is a connection interruption the file must be uploaded again from the beginning, and large files will hold a single connection open for a long time depending on the size of the file and the bandwidth of the connection. This is problematic in Cloud since connections are not held open indefinitely, and most web servers have an idle timeout on the connections. They will thus be killed if the file takes too long.

Using a library that can chunk the uploads into multiple requests instead of a single POST request will mitigate the issues with connections being killed due to timeouts, and will make the upload more robust in cases of poor connections, allowing the browser to resume an upload instead of having to start from the beginning every time.

This requires both server side and client side code to work, and there are several existing libraries that implement this. Since MapD Cloud does not use MapD Webserver we should ensure whichever library is chosen is easily integrated into both, however it may be deemed unnecessary to have this functionality in MapD Webserver at all. Legacy mode should still be supported for older browsers anyway, and a detection could be done on the Immerse side to see if the destination webserver supported the chunked uploads. 

Initial investigation shows these are two that are likely easily integrated into MapD Cloud:

https://github.com/23/resumable.js - likely the most compatible
https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - requires jquery

User unable to cross filter by dimension to non-choropleth chart with geospatial data set when binning of dim. is off,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4557,327944201,4557,[object Object],2018-05-31T00:11:47Z,2018-06-08T00:40:17Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
Currently, user are unable to  cross filter by dimension (**w/ binning turned off**) non-choropleth chart using table that has geospatial. 

_Note: Cross filtering by measure seems to work_

**Example 1,** if user creates  geo choropleth chart for nyc building foot print and a table with Dimension: `cntrct_yr` (**binning switched off**) and Measure: `height`, and attempts to cross filter choropleth by selecting `cnstrct_yr` from table. It would trigger a `Unhandled promise rejection Error: Exception: Parse failed:` and no filter would be generated.

**Dashboard link:** http://immerse-master.prod.frontend.builds.mapd.com/#/dashboard/667?_k=tz2hj6

- **Actual result:**
Although filter icon can be seen on chart, filter is not applied
- **Expected result:**
- Filter can be applied successfully

**Example 2**, Similarly, if user create a pie chart and table (both with the same dimensions) using a data set with geospatial data (i.e.` nyc_buildings`) and filters by dimension (**Dim. Col. needs to be numeric with binning switched off**) , it would also trigger a Error:
`raygun.js:1721 Error: Exception: Parse failed: Encountered ""= ["" at line 1, column 59.` and no filter is generated as well.

Note: From the filter icon, filter count seems to be limited to 1. For example, a user could select multiple rows on table,  but from filter icon count would still be 1. 

Also Note: If user attempts to create multiple filters to non-choropleth chart and theres a choropleth chart in dashboard, it would generate `Unhandled promise rejection Error: Exception: Parse failed: Encountered

Add a legend to BE-rendered pointmap for when accumulation rendering/density gradient mode is active. 
Currently there is no legend and it is unclear to the user what value the colors represent. All they get is the intuition by color alone what is more dense. But by how much? Adding a legend could make that clear.

The values to use for the legend are currently returned as meta-data as part of the render_vega() call to the server. These returned values in the meta-data can be used to drive a legend.

The behavior of the legend can than be similar to other quantitative legends - when locking the colors can stay fixed, when unlocked, the colors would be dynamic.

I would expect to see bars or at maybe a value of 0 when using min, avg and other aggregations that currently just doesn't show any bars. Maybe we are filtering out zeroes as if they were nulls. There are some values on `max`, so the values are definitely not just nulls.

A separate issue in the same area is `stddev` aggregation gives an error: `Exception: Aggregate function STDDEV not supported`

`# unique` also gives an error: `Exception: Parse failed: Lexical error at line 1, column 292.  Encountered: ""#"" (35), after : """"`

Conceptual for future discussions.  - The following mockup is only to start discussions of what improvements we might make in the future to the chart editor panels. Please don't take anything in these screens as planned work.

Some of the ideas in this design:

1. Combining the most if not all of the right panel content into a more contextual left panel.
2. (not really depicted here), identifying Dashboard versus individual chart data source(s). Basically allowing the user to set a dashboard source file as the default that is used in most of the charts so the user doesn't have to keeps looking for and selecting the same data set.
3. (also not really depicted here very well) show dashboard applied filters.
4. Have chart type selector. An idea here is that we could potentially do progressive disclosure of what objects need or can be included based on the type of chart the user selects. Example if the user select the number chart we could hide the dimension selector. *Note that we currently do a decent job of telling the user the differences with a tool tip. If we turned this information into logic we could guide the user through chart set up and chart changes.
5. Under Dimension use a date range as a default. Basically any chart that is based on trend or time/date comparison.  Also identifying not only the date range but also the date aggregate that we would display by default. (currently presented as Bins). This selector would be mirrored in the chart presentation area as well. 
6. For measures we  would continue to provide calculation type in addition to formatting, chart selection (when it makes sense to do so) chart color selector, and if additional filtering was applied.
7. In use cases like combo charts we could have the additional set for the second Y axis.
8. In the chart the color would be indicated with the Y labels. 
9. The y Labels would also display the calculation type.

Please do poke holes and provide ideas. Treat this issue as an open forum for UX ideas and improvements.

Allow choosing a lon / lat or a lat / lon column type in the preview of the table importer, which will consume the following column as well creating a dual longitude / latitude or latitude / longitude Point-type geo column.

[Design spike] Consolidate chart types,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4513,325335064,4513,,2018-05-22T15:01:18Z,2018-05-22T15:03:25Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
We have multiple chart types that are in fact variants of the same base type. The most obvious is row chart, histogram, stacked bar, combo chart (with simple and grouped bars). We also are in an intermediate stage where the line chart is not yet removed from the UI, even though it is fully replicated by the combo chart (task #4050). Another example is scatterplot and bubble chart. They have different implementations, but from the user standpoint, they could be treated as variants.

One way of consolidating the chart types, from a conceptual standpoint without thinking of implementation constraints, could be to have 3 base charts: geo, categorical and continuous

**Geo**
It's clear how all of our maps are of the geo type. Small detail: from implementation standpoint, the scatterplot is backend-rendered and some of its feature visually show that it is somewhat related. 

**Categorical**
The row chart, pie chart and stacked bar charts have categorical data on their primary axis.

**Continuous**
Scatterplot/bubble, combo, histogram, have a continuous primary axis, which can be time, numerical or a binning of those (which could still be considered a discretization of a continuous space rather than an ordinal dimension).

Carlson Capital would like to have a combo chart but still using Crossfilter instead of mapd-data-layer, so they can just plug it in their current setup. The best would probably be to wrap the mapd3 combo chart in mapd-charting, a bit like we are currently doing for the cross-filtering side of combo chart. 

Questions from MikeG, *answers by @biovisualize*:
1. Can we do combo chart with mapd-charting, or do we need mapd3? *No*
2. If mapd3, can we tie it into crossfilter? *It should be possible. We need to try it*
3. Can you somehow do joins in crossfilter? *I don't know Crossfilter enough to answer*

- Sorting
- Filtering
- Searching
- Saved Views (combination of sort, filter and display settings)
- Pre filters (things like: Recents, Favorites, Shared with me, Shared by me, etc.)


- Different presentation styles, cards displayed with some type of grid system, current data grid/table. 
- Thumbnail images of the reports 


Advanced features:
- Auto Perge
- Reassign Dashboard to someone else
- Tagging system
- Foldering system

"Selecting ""Duplicate"" pops a modal that allows the user to keep the appended (copy) as the name or the ability to rename the dashboard to something new",https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4479,322046010,4479,,2018-05-10T19:04:35Z,2018-05-14T18:35:50Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

MVP - when a user chooses to duplicate a dashboard (assuming they have permission to do) the duplicate shows up the in the dashboard list as ""originalName(copy)"". If the user is not satisfied with the ""(Copy)"" appended as the new name they can then select the dashboard and rename it.

This MVP flow can be seen starting with slide 30 from [The DM-Permission-Sharing ISG First Drop Prototype](https://invis.io/MPIGRA7BGXF). 

- The enhancement for this workflow would be as follows:

1 - A user selects a dashboard and chooses to duplicate it

2 - Rather than placing the new duplicate in the list view with ""OriginalName(Copy)"", instead we would launch a ""Duplicate"" modal that shows the name field with the ""OriginalName(Copy)"" pre-populated and highlighted. 

3 - the user has two choices. Choice A is to simply select the done button (or enter keystroke) and keep the ""OriginalName(Copy)"" name or Choice B, they rename the dashboard to a new more meaningful name then click done.

To see the enhanced flow: Look for the easter egg targets on Slide [31](https://invis.io/MPIGRA7BGXF).  just below the grid on the right side. 

- **_In short the enhanced modal is basically duplicate and rename in a single modal._**

Was originally added to autopopulate the geojoin with a ""self join"" for backend choropleth. Now that self joins are no longer necessary to just render the geo data, the actions and reducers are not being used. Leaving the code in place for now since we might want to use it later if we add joins across the product. Worth discussing after 4.0. 

Relevant action is `SELECT_GEO_JOIN_DATA_SOURCE_REQUEST`

There is a difference in how certain Timestamps are displayed Binned, Extracted vs. with Formatting applied (and also in the SQL Editor)
A timestamp like: `2011-01-01 00:00:00`
will appear as Dec 31, 2010 with formatting applied and in the SQL Editor, but will display Jan 1, 2011 while binned or extracted.
Extracted/Binned with no formatting tends to 'round up' while the SQL Editor and The formatting dropdown menu tend to 'round down'.

Re-implement a relatively digestible, yet complex saga from Immerse in other async Redux flow patterns and frameworks, so that we can see a real-world example of how they look and act:

- redux-observable
- redux-thunk + Promises (async / await, some Promise action translator such as redux-promise-middleware)

> So Eric has pulled the KML & KMZ versions of the NYC building footprints dataset, and neither of them will load. The underlying LibKML parser fails with an out-of-memory error. Not even a GDAL problem. ogrinfo command-line tool reports the same, so it's nothing we are provoking. It's a big KML (1.1GB) but looks fine in a text editor. All the other versions of that data set load fine, as do other smaller KMLs I have. LibKML on my system is an Ubuntu lib, as is GDAL itself (although I have my own build of GDAL 2.3 using the same LibKML). LibKML code is from Google but old (not touched for five years) and the Ubuntu version seems to be up-to-date. Thoughts?
> 
> I have proven that the problem is in LibKML itself, and shows up even with my own build of that and a simple test program to just try and open the file. Turns out there are two KML ""drivers"" in GDAL, and if you configure GDAL to use the other one instead (which you can do even in the MapD context just by setting an env var) then the other one loads it, but drops all the extended fields from the file, so you only get the name and the geo for each feature.
> 
> I think we can justifiably ignore this one as there's a workaround, even if not a very good one, and IMHO, anyone who creates a 1.1GB KML file wants their brain examining along with those who create similarly large GeoJSONs...
> 
> For completeness, the LibKML one is falling over in the basic XML parse (using the Expat lib, presumably from the Ubuntu apt DSO install of such)
> 
> LibKML attempts to read in the entire document and gets Expat to parse the whole thing in one go. This is stupid, as Expat is explicitly written to support streaming and parsing of such files in chunks.

Auto Populate Longitude and Latitude on the map charts,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4615,329243309,4615,,2018-06-04T22:48:06Z,2018-06-04T22:48:06Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description


For the charts that use longitude and latitude, we should see if we could auto-populate these fields for the user.  Example if the data column is title Longitude or Long, we could populate either of these in the longitude and same for latitude. 

In the use cases where the data has multiple longitudes and latitudes columns, we could offer a drop menu asking which one they would like to use. An example in the flights_123M data, there are two sets. dest_lat/dest_lon and origin_lat/orgin_log. The drop menu could be as simple as **dest** and **origin**, and based on the user's selection we populate the correct longitude and latitude fields. 


.........
Some difficulties that we will have:
- if the user titles the longitude and latitude something that is unrecognizable.   
- possibly when we are trying to identify if the Geo data has points versus longitude/latitude.

Missing a removable GEO Zoom Filter Indicator,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4614,329239747,4614,,2018-06-04T22:31:30Z,2018-06-05T05:03:56Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

When a user has a dashboard open and they zoom to a particular area this is treated as a filter. The problem is we don't show it as a filter in the cross filter section thus the user doesn't have a way to clear such filter. 

To make things worse, if the user had zoomed/or moved to an area that doesn't have data, this zeros out the rest of their charts in that dashboard. This can lead to a lot of confusion when the user doesn't realize what chart has the filter thus we should always place a clearable filter at the top filter area like we do with other filters. 



Desired behavior would be to either return the user their previous zoom state that had data or to a zoom to all data state (meaning the zoomed map would show to the size or where any data points exist).

Address confusion around filtering and zooming. ,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4613,329235505,4613,,2018-06-04T22:12:53Z,2018-06-04T22:40:40Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

Users have different intentions at different times.  Sometimes the user is intending on cross filtering based on a particular location(s) or based on a particular date/time range. 

Other times their intentions are to change their view to move around or to zoom in particular data in a map or move around to see data over different dates. 

The current behavior is to treat zooming as a filter (kind of).  This causes a lot of confusion and in some cases could render a dashboard useless without giving the user any idea why they are no longer seeing any data. 

One suggestion is to make an implicit request from the user to know their intent. Another is to use a different type of controls.

However, we offer these enhancements we need to give users the ability to both in an intuitive way.



>>>>>
One quick win that we could do is place a clearable filter pill anytime we are treating the zoom as a filter.

As a result, I would like to start to do some design cycles on this as soon as possible.




Some obvious changes:
- Change button color. The current light teal button color doesn't offer enough contrast.
- Change the light gray background areas to be dark enough to create passing contrast.
- Place tooltips on all icons
- Possibly offer alternative CSS to allow user control over text size, and additional contrast, etc.
- Test current font size, weight, and shades throughout the app.
- Continued work on default minimum size on charting elements. 
- Add points to things like line charts to make it easier to locate where the hover is.
- Improve zoom controls
- more to come.

For example, @AnnetteMapD mentioned that using a dark to light palette is not so intuitive for the NY Taxi heatmap. Let's have a round of design to make sure our demos are reflecting the best practices we can provide.

As gravy we should probably at least slot in # Records as the measure so it renders straight away. A better thing would not to require a measure at all for rendering a poly table, and the user could just pick the static color of each poly (like most GIS systems work).

The scatter map can be reset by removing the filter, but it would be nice if there was some limitation even if the user decides to use this chart incorrectly. 

The infinite zoom also causes errors in the console and will actually hang immerse with certain datasets and measurements while the zooming in/out past a reasonable measure.

Enhance file upload to use chunking instead of multi part POST request ,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4563,328254891,4563,,2018-05-31T18:48:57Z,2018-05-31T18:48:57Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
Currently the file uploader has a nice progress bar that gives feedback to the user, however it uses a multipart POST request that holds a single request open waiting for a response. The implications of this are that if there is a connection interruption the file must be uploaded again from the beginning, and large files will hold a single connection open for a long time depending on the size of the file and the bandwidth of the connection. This is problematic in Cloud since connections are not held open indefinitely, and most web servers have an idle timeout on the connections. They will thus be killed if the file takes too long.

Using a library that can chunk the uploads into multiple requests instead of a single POST request will mitigate the issues with connections being killed due to timeouts, and will make the upload more robust in cases of poor connections, allowing the browser to resume an upload instead of having to start from the beginning every time.

This requires both server side and client side code to work, and there are several existing libraries that implement this. Since MapD Cloud does not use MapD Webserver we should ensure whichever library is chosen is easily integrated into both, however it may be deemed unnecessary to have this functionality in MapD Webserver at all. Legacy mode should still be supported for older browsers anyway, and a detection could be done on the Immerse side to see if the destination webserver supported the chunked uploads. 

Initial investigation shows these are two that are likely easily integrated into MapD Cloud:

User unable to cross filter by dimension to non-choropleth chart with geospatial data set when binning of dim. is off,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4557,327944201,4557,[object Object],2018-05-31T00:11:47Z,2018-06-08T00:40:17Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
Currently, user are unable to  cross filter by dimension (**w/ binning turned off**) non-choropleth chart using table that has geospatial. 

_Note: Cross filtering by measure seems to work_

**Example 1,** if user creates  geo choropleth chart for nyc building foot print and a table with Dimension: `cntrct_yr` (**binning switched off**) and Measure: `height`, and attempts to cross filter choropleth by selecting `cnstrct_yr` from table. It would trigger a `Unhandled promise rejection Error: Exception: Parse failed:` and no filter would be generated.

**Dashboard link:** http://immerse-master.prod.frontend.builds.mapd.com/#/dashboard/667?_k=tz2hj6

- **Actual result:**
Although filter icon can be seen on chart, filter is not applied
- **Expected result:**
- Filter can be applied successfully

**Example 2**, Similarly, if user create a pie chart and table (both with the same dimensions) using a data set with geospatial data (i.e.` nyc_buildings`) and filters by dimension (**Dim. Col. needs to be numeric with binning switched off**) , it would also trigger a Error:
`raygun.js:1721 Error: Exception: Parse failed: Encountered ""= ["" at line 1, column 59.` and no filter is generated as well.

### :memo: Other Info
Note: From the filter icon, filter count seems to be limited to 1. For example, a user could select multiple rows on table,  but from filter icon count would still be 1. 

Also Note: If user attempts to create multiple filters to non-choropleth chart and theres a choropleth chart in dashboard, it would generate `Unhandled promise rejection Error: Exception: Parse failed: Encountered
` error

Add a legend to BE-rendered pointmap for when accumulation rendering/density gradient mode is active. 
Currently there is no legend and it is unclear to the user what value the colors represent. All they get is the intuition by color alone what is more dense. But by how much? Adding a legend could make that clear.

The values to use for the legend are currently returned as meta-data as part of the render_vega() call to the server. These returned values in the meta-data can be used to drive a legend.

The behavior of the legend can than be similar to other quantitative legends - when locking the colors can stay fixed, when unlocked, the colors would be dynamic.

I would expect to see bars or at maybe a value of 0 when using min, avg and other aggregations that currently just doesn't show any bars. Maybe we are filtering out zeroes as if they were nulls. There are some values on `max`, so the values are definitely not just nulls.

A separate issue in the same area is `stddev` aggregation gives an error: `Exception: Aggregate function STDDEV not supported`

`# unique` also gives an error: `Exception: Parse failed: Lexical error at line 1, column 292.  Encountered: ""#"" (35), after : """"`

Some of the ideas in this design:

1. Combining the most if not all of the right panel content into a more contextual left panel.
2. (not really depicted here), identifying Dashboard versus individual chart data source(s). Basically allowing the user to set a dashboard source file as the default that is used in most of the charts so the user doesn't have to keeps looking for and selecting the same data set.
3. (also not really depicted here very well) show dashboard applied filters.
4. Have chart type selector. An idea here is that we could potentially do progressive disclosure of what objects need or can be included based on the type of chart the user selects. Example if the user select the number chart we could hide the dimension selector. *Note that we currently do a decent job of telling the user the differences with a tool tip. If we turned this information into logic we could guide the user through chart set up and chart changes.
5. Under Dimension use a date range as a default. Basically any chart that is based on trend or time/date comparison.  Also identifying not only the date range but also the date aggregate that we would display by default. (currently presented as Bins). This selector would be mirrored in the chart presentation area as well. 
6. For measures we  would continue to provide calculation type in addition to formatting, chart selection (when it makes sense to do so) chart color selector, and if additional filtering was applied.
7. In use cases like combo charts we could have the additional set for the second Y axis.
8. In the chart the color would be indicated with the Y labels. 
9. The y Labels would also display the calculation type.

Please do poke holes and provide ideas. Treat this issue as an open forum for UX ideas and improvements.

[Geo import] Add support for dual lon / lat column type to table importer,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4515,325478891,4515,,2018-05-22T22:00:10Z,2018-05-22T23:52:41Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

Allow choosing a lon / lat or a lat / lon column type in the preview of the table importer, which will consume the following column as well creating a dual longitude / latitude or latitude / longitude Point-type geo column.

The header for the columns should somehow indicate they are paired together (one way might be to indicate Latitude and Longitude as lighter, grey sub headers and have the main header only on the left column).

[Design spike] Consolidate chart types,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4513,325335064,4513,,2018-05-22T15:01:18Z,2018-05-22T15:03:25Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
We have multiple chart types that are in fact variants of the same base type. The most obvious is row chart, histogram, stacked bar, combo chart (with simple and grouped bars). We also are in an intermediate stage where the line chart is not yet removed from the UI, even though it is fully replicated by the combo chart (task #4050). Another example is scatterplot and bubble chart. They have different implementations, but from the user standpoint, they could be treated as variants.

One way of consolidating the chart types, from a conceptual standpoint without thinking of implementation constraints, could be to have 3 base charts: geo, categorical and continuous

**Geo**
It's clear how all of our maps are of the geo type. Small detail: from implementation standpoint, the scatterplot is backend-rendered and some of its feature visually show that it is somewhat related. 

**Categorical**
The row chart, pie chart and stacked bar charts have categorical data on their primary axis.

**Continuous**
Scatterplot/bubble, combo, histogram, have a continuous primary axis, which can be time, numerical or a binning of those (which could still be considered a discretization of a continuous space rather than an ordinal dimension).

Carlson Capital would like to have a combo chart but still using Crossfilter instead of mapd-data-layer, so they can just plug it in their current setup. The best would probably be to wrap the mapd3 combo chart in mapd-charting, a bit like we are currently doing for the cross-filtering side of combo chart. 

Questions from MikeG, *answers by @biovisualize*:
1. Can we do combo chart with mapd-charting, or do we need mapd3? *No*
2. If mapd3, can we tie it into crossfilter? *It should be possible. We need to try it*
3. Can you somehow do joins in crossfilter? *I don't know Crossfilter enough to answer*

"Selecting ""Duplicate"" pops a modal that allows the user to keep the appended (copy) as the name or the ability to rename the dashboard to something new",https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4479,322046010,4479,,2018-05-10T19:04:35Z,2018-05-14T18:35:50Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

MVP - when a user chooses to duplicate a dashboard (assuming they have permission to do) the duplicate shows up the in the dashboard list as ""originalName(copy)"". If the user is not satisfied with the ""(Copy)"" appended as the new name they can then select the dashboard and rename it.

This MVP flow can be seen starting with slide 30 from [The DM-Permission-Sharing ISG First Drop Prototype](https://invis.io/MPIGRA7BGXF). 

- The enhancement for this workflow would be as follows:

1 - A user selects a dashboard and chooses to duplicate it

2 - Rather than placing the new duplicate in the list view with ""OriginalName(Copy)"", instead we would launch a ""Duplicate"" modal that shows the name field with the ""OriginalName(Copy)"" pre-populated and highlighted. 

3 - the user has two choices. Choice A is to simply select the done button (or enter keystroke) and keep the ""OriginalName(Copy)"" name or Choice B, they rename the dashboard to a new more meaningful name then click done.

To see the enhanced flow: Look for the easter egg targets on Slide [31](https://invis.io/MPIGRA7BGXF).  just below the grid on the right side. 

- **_In short the enhanced modal is basically duplicate and rename in a single modal._**

"Download via S3 holds incomplete connection open until all files are processed, and no feedback to the user is given in the event of failure",https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4477,322001769,4477,,2018-05-10T16:48:23Z,2018-05-10T16:51:45Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
The S3 download UI sends a `detect_column_types` Thrift request, presents a blue spinner to the user, and waits for a response.

In cases where many files are being downloaded from S3, the response to this request may take minutes or even hours. In non-local environments or environments using reverse proxies and load balancers, idle connections are dropped after a configurable timeout in order to conserve resources. Keeping a connection open like this is not expected and usually indicates a problem with the application (from a reverse proxy / load balancer perspective) because this looks the same as something on the back end timing out due to a problem - there is no way to distinguish. 

For example, the default Apache timeout for idle connections is 5 minutes, and in MapD Cloud loading S3 files that takes more than 5 minutes causes a 504 Gateway Timeout error. There is no feedback to the user about this and they continue to see the spinning blue disc forever until they refresh. Unless they are monitoring the Thrift calls they will never know what is going on. We have, for now, worked around this issue by increasing the timeout to 30 minutes, however this is not a recommended practice as it can lead to exhausted resources if there are legitimately hung services on the back end, and any large loads that take more than 30 mins will still exhibit the same behavior.

### :computer: Environment
- **Browser Name, Version**:  Any
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: 3.6.1rc6

### :page_with_curl: Steps To Reproduce
- Download large amounts of data via the S3 downloader (eg. s3://mapd-cloud/truefx/) (which takes about 9 minutes in MapD Cloud) in an environment that has a connection timeout configured on the web server

- **Actual result:**
The blue spinner appears while the `detect_column_types` request is sent:

`[1,""detect_column_types"",1,0,{""1"":{""str"":""5Qzntvr2VHteWgE49PxxxxMfi0YQW01h""},""2"":{""str"":""s3://mapd-cloud/truefx/""},""3"":{""rec"":{""1"":{""str"":""""},""2"":{""str"":""""},""4"":{""tf"":1},""12"":{""i32"":0},""13"":{""str"":""""},""14"":{""str"":""""},""15"":{""str"":""us-east-1""}}}}]`

In the background the connection times out and returns an http 504, the front end continues to show the spiner

- **Expected result:**
Either showing the actual progress like the file uploader does, or at the very least returning the error to the user so they know it has failed with the HTTP error code, like the file uploader does in the event of failure.

This could likely be turned into an epic, but we'll keep it simple for now. 

If I want to join `contributions` to `zipcodes` on `contributor_zipcode = zipcodes.ZCTA5CE10`, I need to know that `ZCTA5CE10` is the column in `zipcodes` that has the zipcode data matching that in `contributor_zipcode` (namely each zipcode as a 5 digit number). We could actually determine the most likely column that matches by running a count query on each column in the geojoin datasource joining on the column selected in the dimension. For example...

`SELECT count(*) FROM contributions, zipcodes WHERE (contributions.contributor_zipcode = zipcodes.ZCTA5CE10) LIMIT 1000` 

Replacing `contributions.contributor_zipcode` with each column in the `zipcodes` table. Since it is likely that only one column will have any matches at all, we could bail early as soon as we got a few hits (or a few hundred hits). 

(I added a limit in there because I don't think that would cause any issues finding the right column, and it would keep memory usage low). 

We may want to add some UI/UX to tell the user a column was auto-selected or in case we couldn't find a match.

Immerse should be able to automatically package all the required files for shapefile import without having to manually do so. <enhancement>

Also, the .prj needs to be packaged if found. This file may or may not exist, but if it does exist, it must be included. See #4441

When importing shapefiles (.shp) thru immerse data manager, it requires the .shp, .shx, & .dbf files.
Immerse should also require the .prj file if it exists. That is important. If it exists and is not imported with the other files, things can go haywire as the .prj describes the coordinate system of the imported shapefile data.

Customer Feature Request: Verizon

 
At Verizon, there are both large scale users, and small scale users. The small scale users are typically more autonomous and are attempting to perform the data prep, data-loading, and SQL themselves, with little or no assistance. In this context, it is not intuitively obvious to a SME working autonomously, that a secondary table in a standard SQL table join would need to be schema-directed REPLICATED, especially if the user has no visibility into the underlying architecture.

Complicating problems: 
1. Immerse does not allow a Drag & Drop ""REPLICATED"" directive. 
2. The only user-visibility for an incorrectly created (i.e. schema without a REPLICATED directive) JOIN-table is an Immerse-failure, when the join is attempted.

Comment: 
- it was suggested that some sort of user-friendly procedure to facilitate Immerse Drag & Drop capability when loading tables intended as 'join-secondary' tables. 
- Possibly a Immerse-DataManager option to replicate tables in a MapD cluster 
- if MapD cannot reliably deduce a replication directive from a SQL join, then an Immerse DataManager option would help an SME to be more autonomous

The stacked bar chart handle clicking on the whole column to use it as a global filter. We could support clicking on individual segments instead. The segment selection would replace the column selection. it will require some changes to the query. 

From @mythilimapd 
>This will involve some work on CF I think because we have to compose an AND filter that takes both the dimensions
So if you have Region on x-axis and Product as the stack dimension, when you click on Product `P1` on Region `East` the filter clause would be `WHERE Region = East and Product = P1`

ISG  updated their rest API to send in additional information to let us know which logo to serve based on logged in user.  The flow is - the REST API will return a new logo key and a reference to an asset which will still live on a file system, but we need to establish how this ‘switch’ between possibly multiple logos will be done within Immerse. Specifically, the call will now have an additional param ‘logo:bla’ and the config file will have ‘bla: /dir/bla_logo.png’

In `updateChartType`, the following `if` statement appears to always evaluate to true:

```
    if (prevState.type !== ""line"" || prevState.type !== ""histogram"") {
      dispatch(destroyChart(chartId, prevState))
    }
```
https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/blob/master/src/actions/charts-action-creators.js#L108

Presumably this is because the prevState is always either not a line or not a histogram. I did some testing and confirmed that placing a log statement in with the dispatch always shows the log text in the console. Not sure what the statement was intended for or what the ramifications are of removing it and just dispatching `destroyChart` for every chart type update.

### Notes from #3917
@Christian-Baptiste 
I am working on several new color pallets. Do we have any reference of how
many colors per pallet we would need or should have?  This set has 45. It
also blends the colors in a way that shades can be seen even if colors can
not (color blind).
![image.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5aa83f834b5806bc2bcab856/75ec1cf1-8e3b-4ecf-93be-471a87780513)

@clhenrick 
@Christian-Baptiste this is for a categorical / ordinal color scheme? I start to question whether or not anyone can differentiate colors when there are more than 7, but if it works it works!

One color scheme tool I often resort to is colorbrewer. Here's their 12 color ""qualitative"" color scheme: http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Paired&n=12 which as the tool indicates, is not suitable for color blindness.

@biovisualize
@Christian-Baptiste If we have a large set of colors, we also need a way to pick a smaller set from it, so we are not stuck just picking up like the first n from the set, which would just have a bunch of similar colors.

Of course, this set is fine for categorical colors, but we will also need linear, maybe divergent.

Here are the colors we are currently using, for reference https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/blob/master/src/constants/colors.js

@Christian-Baptiste
Yep,  This set is primarily for larger data sets and/or stacked content.
Agreed we need different type of pallets for different chart types.

```
It shouldn't be whether rendering millions of elements is possible, but minimizing the data transferred and rendered to give the user what they want to see. Heatmaps are two dimensional so it doesn't make sense to just take the top n along both groups. We need to use a subquery to get the top X groups of for the x axis dimension (if categorical) and the top Y groups of the y axis dimension. Ideally we do this dynamically so the groups could change as crossfiltered (but may want to allow an ability to lock like we do for other charts). The query would look like this: select X as key0, Y as key1, count() as color from table where key0 in (select x from table group by x order by count() desc limit x_cardinality) and key1 in (select y from table group by y order by count() desc limit y_cardinality) (Note we'd probably like to use similar query structure to get the dynamic top k groups we've talked about for line and histogram charts when grouping by categorical dimensions).

One of the practical issues with just going with at_most_n is I suspect the heatmap is creating cells for all groups along the two axes even if there is not data. So if I return two rows, ""New York X United Airlines"" and ""Florida X American Airlines"" it will likely create svg elements for the empty cells ""New York X American Airlines"" and ""Florida X United Airlines"". In pathological cases (imagine grouping a user_name on twitter by user_id), we could end up creating limit^2 number of cells.

Again we may want to punt on this but just expressing my two cents on why just a flat limit or at_most_n is at most a partial band-aid on the problem.
```
(from #2281)

```SELECT origin as key0, CASE WHEN carrier_name IN ('Southwest Airlines', 'American Airlines', 'Delta Air Lines', 'United Air Lines', 'Northwest Airlines') THEN carrier_name ELSE 'undefined' END as key1, count(*) as val FROM flights_123M WHERE (((dep_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP(0) '2002-09-01 00:00:00' AND dep_timestamp <= TIMESTAMP(0) '2005-07-01 00:00:00'))) AND origin in (select origin FROM flights_123M GROUP BY origin ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 100) GROUP BY key0, key1 ORDER BY val DESC```

this is the new subquery: select origin FROM flights_123M GROUP BY origin ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 100
technically the color by part could be done a subquery as well instead of a separate pre-flight query but thats likely another task b/c it will interact with our color logic
also note that LIMIT 100 would change to however many bars you want",biovisualize,stacked-bar-chart,0,

Complexity:
Without stretch goals: 52
If we disable the color palette features from the MVP: 37
With stretch goals: 66

So if we do everything except the stretch goal, if we are 1.5 devs on it, the wall clock time could be 2.5 weeks. That's the lower limit and only reflects the ideal case.

* @clhenrick will be in vacation next week
* @biovisualize is collaborating, but is also on another project

- [x] Number of groups slider
- [x] Color palette (to be broken down, all others, add/remove color, change color)
- [x] Horizontal scrolling, bar autosizing 
- [ ] Data layer (infra)
- [x] Null dimension selector
- [x] dimensions and measure settings in `src/constants/charts.js` (infra)
- [ ] Chart switching (QA)
- [x] Labels for second dimensions in tooltip
- [ ] Properly handle negative values (stretch goal?)
- [ ] Errors to pop-up (stretch goal)
- [ ] support bins for x-axis (stretch goal)

**Done**
- [x] Drag and drop dimension/measures
- [x] Selector for single measure, 2 dimensions (2nd dimension sub-category instead of color)
- [x] Can be colored by single color, dimension
- [x] hide x axis horizontal line (vertical tick marks are sufficient for bar charts, the horizontal line can give the impression that the data is continuous and not discrete)
- [x] limit number of bars to 100
- [x] enable horizontal scrolling of bar marks container
- [x] New chart type icon
- [x] Defaults to bar, 2nd dimension makes it stacked
- [x] use vertical bar icon for chart selection
- [x] rename modules from `line2` to `bar` in `src/charts/bar-chart/`
- [x] namespace action types so they don't cause side effects with `line2` reducer
- [x] integrate `mapd-data-layer` for categorical data
- [x] enable sorting by dimension or measure
- [x] integrate `mapd3`'s stacked bar chart component
- [x] feature is exposed via a `document.cookie` similar to `line2`
- [x] only support stacking of bars (not grouping)

* Implement the transitions
* Trying to avoid irrelevant transitions like on the old chart that sometimes lack ""object constency""

Error handling makes dashboard unusable,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4191,307916163,4191,,2018-03-23T06:28:31Z,2018-03-23T06:28:31Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description

I had been working with a dashboard, and eventually got `Error: Exception: Not enough host memory to execute the query`. (I think that message was in a dialog, but I copied the text later from the JS console.)

In the server log, this is:
```
I0322 23:25:20.196743 16063 BufferMgr.cpp:39] OOM trace:
runImpl:288

E0322 23:25:20.196916 16044 MapDHandler.cpp:2606] Exception: Not enough host memory to execute the query
```

I was able to dismiss that error dialog and continue with the dashboard.  One of the charts had a spinner that never stopped.

I clicked Clear Filters, and the error happened again.  I went to Dashboards and re-opened it, got the error again.  This time, I cleared filters and Saved, then re-opened it.  Now, I only get:
```
FAILED TO RENDER DASHBOARD
""Do you want to report this error?""
REPORT NO
```

Either button closes the dashboard, so now my work is lost, until I buy more memory. :(

The JS console for that error only says ""error"".  But it's the same OOM in the server log.

Currently backend errors, usually just from whatever module is generating it, are shown directly on Immerse for problems with S3 import. Must improve these either by:

2) String-matching error messages from backend and keying them to user-friendly messages

This PR also changes the default backend server for development specified in `src/servers.json` to `mahakali`, since that is the server that is used by the CI Builds, and it's easier to verify bugs when you don't have to manually port a dashboard from `mahakali` to `kali`.  happy to open a separate issue and PR for this change if we'd like.

**instructions to the dev reviewer**   
please ignore `console.log()`s that are `eslint-disable-line`-d.  
I'll remove that dev logging once all other dev review feedback is provided, prior to merging this PR.

[Combo Chart] Brush selection loses precision with repeated changes to binning,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/4107,304099635,4107,,2018-03-10T19:57:07Z,2018-03-12T17:29:21Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
Switching between binning options, over time, appears to create a rounding error where the original ""all the way to the right"" selection is reduced to the extent of the decade or year bin. If the range chart is hidden, this is not obvious. On the Line chart, which has its own quirky behavior, it's at least visible in the chart when the full dataset is not part of the current selection.

-Set **Y Axis 1** to *arrdelay*.
-Brush a selection in the range chart from somewhere in the middle all the way to the right.
-Hide the range chart.
-Change the binning many times

- **Actual result:**
Over time, the selection no longer reaches the far right edge, possibly due to rounding algorithms used for the 1yr and 10yr bins.

- **Expected result:**
When I select all the way to the right, my intent is to persistently select everything from a particular point in time to the end of the dataset. If it doesn't extend that far, I need some indication in the main chart when the range chart is hidden.

Brush a selection in the Combo range chart, switch to Line chart. The selected range is shown as if it were the full dataset. Switch back to Combo chart, and the same selection persists. You can't drag to get the full set back, but you can edit the x axis. Make another selection and switch back to Line chart, the data persists.

Editing the primary or secondary y axis labels has various issues: mixing edited label with autogenerated, applying the new label to the other axis, etc. They all have the same issue from the code standpoint. The behaviour we want is:
* replace the whole label when edited

The cause is simply that the measure index was hardcoded before we introduced axis orientation switching
```
[line2ActionTypes.SET_Y_AXIS_LABEL] (state, {id, label}) {
    const measures = clone(state[id].measures)
    measures[0].axisLabel = label

With the introduction of combo chart we have 3 charts in Immerse that are very similar.

- Combo Chart
- Line Chart
- Histogram

We should  deprecate the old *line* chart and *histogram* when David and QA team feel confident that all old dashboards that have old *line* and /or *histogram*  can be opened without any ""failed to load dashboard"" messages. 

### Acceptance criteria
**Replace the old line chart by the combo chart**
* Remove old line chart icon
* Line chart in older dashboard will open as combo chart seamlessly and without issue

**Replace histogram implementation by MapD3**
* All histogram functionalities stay the same, but the code uses MapD3
* All backward compatible

As a user, I would like to be able to duplicate an existing chart.  I would like to be able to quickly iterate on a chart design, and see all of my iterations side-by-side on the same Immerse dashboard.  I want to be able to do this with the minimal number of clicks possible. 

I want to click a `duplicate chart` icon and be taken to the chart editor view for my new duplicate chart.  In the chart editor, I want to change the one dimension to column mapping I want to experiment with and click apply to see my new chart iteration on my dashboard next to my old chart.

an end result may look like this:

[on master] when I apply multiple selections on a point map and change the `agg`, not all selections are respected
http://immerse-master.prod.frontend.builds.mapd.com/#/link/mapd/fce89a1a

Hint: It might be related to the binning, we can now bin lon and lat by `avg`, `min` and `max`

### :computer: Environment
- **Browser Name, Version**: Chrome
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master

### :page_with_curl: Steps To Reproduce
- Go to Master
- Create a new dashboard
- Create a new chart
- Select data: `tweets_nov_feb_60M`, D:`followees`, M: `lon` & `lat`
- Change aggregation on measures to `MAX`
- Apply a circle selector filter

[Point Map] Legend min & max reverts to default after changing map themes or any visual attribute setting,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3992,300856170,3992,,2018-02-28T01:24:21Z,2018-06-08T06:22:27Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
Todd noticed an issue where the point maps max/min would revert back to its default values after user has changed the map theme or any visual attribute settings

### :computer: Environment
- **Browser Name, Version**: 
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master

### :page_with_curl: Steps To Reproduce
1. Select point map chart
2. Add the following:
Data Source: nyc_yellow_taxi
Measure - Lon: dropoff_longitude  
Measure - Lat: dropoff_latitude
Measure - Color: total_ amount

3. Change map them or visual attribute (i.e. # of points, Autosize, or Mark Shape settings) 
4. Edit map legend Min/Max value

- **Actual result:**
- Min/max values immediately revert back to default values 
- Note that user is still able to enter min/max legend values prior to changing map theme/visual attribute

- **Expected result:**
- User able to set Min/max value

Line2 adapter's setConfig invokes a render before config has been set,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3991,300851254,3991,,2018-02-28T00:57:42Z,2018-03-02T10:29:49Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
In the line2-adapter's setConfig method, the chart is actually rendered before its config object has been overridden. This is because chart.getEvents() calls render(). This could lead to some unwanted side effects and it probably makes sense to move the event setup outside of setConfig. 

Problematic code here: https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/blob/master/src/charts/line-chart2/line2-adapter.js#L164-L185

As a user, I want to be able to visualize my data nested by a 2nd dimension, for example the sum of my sales (measure) for each region (dimension 2) across each year (dimension 1), so I can make decisions that need a break down of a dimension by another one (like sum(sales) for each year by region).

### Requirements
Copy-pasted from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSbMc3mZwP3Dsu1V2T0uX_00jHJgnTVoZc8gNCdKhPQ/edit)
* Allow ability to stack when adding a second dimension
* Stacked bar chart can have a single color or color by dimension ~or color by measure~
* ~When color by measure, disable color by dimension and when color by dimension, disable color by measure~
* When date extracts are used as groups, default sorting will be chronological within groups and overall
* Default colors when color by dimension ~or color by measure~

### Design specs
Discussion is ongoing here #3919

### Possible task breakdown
**Design decisions**
* Design decisions, particularly the one needed to decide if it will be a separate chart type, replacing histogram or replacing row chart

**Data**
* Figure out the query for stacked bar chart with categorical data
* Hardcode this query in mapd-data-layer

**Chart adapter**
* Add the scaffolding for the new stacked bar chart, probably duplicating what’s in line2 and hardcoding the chart type to `stackedBar`
* Write the data transform using data from the query
* Pipe the right props to update the chart

**Integration and widgets**
* Trigger the hardcoded query when selecting dimension/measure
* Pipe the right info to the query builder to modify the query
* Work on selectors
* Work on color

**MapD3**
* Tooltip
* Selection
* Support negative bars",biovisualize,"Epic,documentation,stacked-bar-chart",1,clhenrick

Prepare all dashboard state for storing in Redux,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3945,299101219,3945,,2018-02-21T19:39:54Z,2018-02-21T19:39:57Z,"## Ongoing goal
As we refactor charts and other dashboard components, either put all of their non-transient state into Redux and mutate with actions, or if not yet feasible due to external interactions and dependencies, prepare them for the eventual move by making the interface reactive (accept all input data wholesale and optimize delta changes, and encapsulate mutations as events).

- Make sure to use mapd-data-layer from https://github.com/mapd/metis wherever possible to translate queries to SQL.

New dashboard replaces an old dashboard if I give it the same title 

### Environment
- **Browser Name, Version**: chrome
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master/minos

### Steps To Reproduce
- Create a **dashboard A** and name the title ""Test Test David"", and **save** it
- Add few charts to **dashboard A**, and **save** it
- Create a **dashboard B** and name the title ""Test Test David"", and **save** it
- Go to dashboards list and search for the dashboard with title ""Test Test David""

**Actual result:**
**dashboard A** is totally wiped and replaced by **dashboard B**

**Expected result:**
Dashboards should not be wiped. I could think of 2 solutions:
1. Show a popup to user and ask them to choose another name
2. Save the new dashboard with additional text (i.e. Test Test David_1)

Immerse incorrectly bins decade time intervals ,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3893,296941538,3893,,2018-02-14T01:02:45Z,2018-02-14T18:47:27Z,"### Description
Relates to #3746 

For example, if my dataset has a natural domain in years of 1987 – 2009, when I bin on decade the domain is altered to 1981 – 2001 thus adding years outside of the dataset's natural domain as well as chopping off the last 8 years (testing this using the `chrisv-basic` dashboard Line Chart on Kali). This seems strange to me.

An alternative method of binning on decades could be to find natural 10 year intervals in the dataset, such as 1987 – 1997 – 2007, instead of forcing it into intervals like 1981 – 1991 – 2001.

Furthermore it seems logical that a decade would start on 1980 then go to 1989, then 1990 – 1999, then 2000 – 2009. Starting on 1981 and not including 1980 within the same decade seems like a bug IMO.

### Environment
- **Browser Name, Version**: 
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master

### Steps To Reproduce
- make a new dashboard
- use flights data set
- choose line1 chart
- x axis arr_timestamp
- y axis count # records
- select ""10y"" for `BIN` option 

- **Actual result:**
when hovering on the chart the tooltip should show date ranges like 1980 – 1989, 1990 – 1999, 2000 – 2009

- **Expected result:**
tooltip shows date ranges like 1981 – 1990, 1991 – 2000, 2001 – 2010

Line2 is not updating data on other charts as fast as old line. Also true when updating focus chart when brushing on range chart.

This task is extracting line2 requirements, to make line2 exactly like old line chart, from #3765 which got conflated and was about a different but related improvement.

## Acceptance criteria
* Line2 should update the other charts at sensibly the same rate as old line chart
* The range chart should update the focus chart at sensibly the same rate too.

## Steps To Reproduce
* Make a dashboard with old line chart and a number chart
* See at what rate brushing on the focus chart refreshes the number chart
* Do the same after switching ole line chart to line2 to compare
* Do the same comparison with the refresh rate on the focus chart when brushing in the range chart

Measure / Dimension Selectors have multiple isOpen state flags,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3809,293739433,3809,,2018-02-02T01:07:11Z,2018-02-06T00:46:14Z,"Relates to #3757 (adding line2 y axis toggle to all measure types)

After reviewing the Measure Selector I noticed the following:

The `<SelectorContainer />` component has a prop called `isDropdownOpen` which, when set to `false` was still rendering its child `<AutoComplete />` component. 

However, the child `<AutoComplete />` component has another prop called `isOpen`, which is what actually determines if the dropdown list is shown.

This is misleading for devs and a bad handling of component level state. Both of these state flags are the result of over usage of Recompose's `withState` and `withHandlers` HOCs that modify the wrapped component and add additional `props` (not to be confused with component level `state`).

What probably needs to happen here is that there should be a **single source of truth** for whether or not the dropdown is open. The top most parent component should set the single flag and this flag should be passed down to `<AutoComplete />`. There should also be a function that updates this flag which should also be passed down to `<Autocomplete />`, so that it may set the `isDropdownOpen` flag from a user interaction.

This is a basic example of ""hoisting state"" in React, and I'm not sure why the original authors didn't follow it and instead created two separate flags for stating whether the dropdown should be open or not. ",clhenrick,"tech,tech-debt",3,

As a user (i.e. at JamCity), I want to visualize my hierarchical data in a sunburst, as it's a chart that makes sense to me, so I can analyze my hierarchical data alongside the rest of my information in Immerse dashboards.

As a developer at MapD, I need to find the most efficient way to integrate any new chart in Immerse.

## Goals
We need to help JamCity integrate a sunburst in Immerse. We already gave them some directions to help them develop a chart that matches the API we use for MapD3. The result is here: https://github.com/dtovbeinJC/mapd3/blob/develop/src/charts/sunburst.js

## Increments (possible deliverables)
The development increments could be:
- [ ] validate this code and improve it or write a new one (sunburst code example)
- [ ] connect it to mapd-core to figure out the query and to show it working in isolation (example of sunburst working with mapd-connector)
- [ ] List the technical specs to prepare the sunburst integration and eventual test plan (spec list)
- [ ] Design the architecture for the React wrapper that will connect it to Immerse (architecture prototype/template)
- [ ] Integrate the sunburst in Immerse (working sunburst in Immerse)

## Priority and scope
This project is not on the top of the priority list, but it has multiple goals that are important:
* Keeping JamCity happy
* Redesigning the pattern to integrate new charts in Immerse so it can be done quickly and in a more robust way
* Showing an example of how the community or clients can build new charts that we can then integrate (or we can provide an Immerse stub or some unit tests to make it even easier)

## Notes
We have multiple Slack channels to sync-up with Jamcity (`ext-jamcity` (private), `cust-jamcity`), but we should let non-dev handle all the communication.",micahstubbs,JamCity,2,uyanga-gb

## Issue Description

Anytime we change any of the visual attributes on a rendered chart the color scale resets.

## Steps To Reproduce

Go to this dashboard: http://immerse-master.prod.frontend.builds.mapd.com/#/link/mapd/5ae0dc94.  Open up the settings panel for the pointmap. change the size domain and range of the dots. Note that the color scale resets to the min and max of the color range.

## Expected Result

We should preserve the color scale (settable via the legend) if only visual attributes change. Note if the dimension or measure is changed we should reset the color scale as we are dealing with actual data.

## Actual Result

Color scale resets on any change to other visual attributes like size.

Some linting rules are a bit constraining without adding much to readability or other benefits of good code style. Let's list them here and disable them. 

Also, let's remove the linting from webpack. It's easy enough to run lint separately and we have a git hook for that.

seems like passing linter is now a precondition to webpack compiling, while this may seem like a great idea, in practice it’s cumbersome given how anal our linting rules are (edited)

>Jonathan Huang [15:09] 
be sure to alphabetize your imports!

>Tai Dupree [15:14] 
so this does bring up an interesting question. Do we change the linting rules or remove the precondition?

>Micah Stubbs [15:18] 
would vote for removing the webpack lint hook. I like the lint hook  at git push best. `on webpack build` or `on commit` hooks slow me down too much... I disable those pretty fast (edited)

Both :slightly_smiling_face: We could start by simply removing rules we don’t want, those that doesn’t require a change, like alphabetic ordering.",biovisualize,tech,1,biovisualize

make use of vega transforms for BE-rendered charts where applicable,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3703,289089266,3703,,2018-01-16T23:16:38Z,2018-04-12T21:55:48Z,"## General Info
- **Platform**: All
- **Browser Name**: All
- **Browser Version**: All
- **Application Version**: master dev

## Issue Description
In a handful of cases where BE-rendered charts are used, a pre-query is run to gather certain statistical information about a pending render query to drive color, or point size, or the like. With the advent of vega transform support (see: https://github.com/mapd/mapd-core-internal/issues/473 & its associated docs: https://github.com/mapd/docs.mapd.com/issues/152), these prequeries can be removed, therefore eliminating the redundancy and performance hit of running these prequeries.

One such example is geo-heatmap. Here is an example of a vega that can be generated by this chart:

```

You'll notice that the `""domain""` property of the `""heat_colorgeoheat""` scale is set to `[1,
176209.51303257493]`. These values are retrieved by running the following pre-query before the render_vega call:

```
SELECT MIN(c.color) as minimum, MAX(c.color) as maximum, STDDEV(c.color) as deviation, AVG(c.color) as mean FROM (SELECT reg_hex_horiz_pixel_bin_x(conv_4326_900913_x(lon),-17552387.676773068,17552387.676773112,conv_4326_900913_y(lat),-9235139.541165564,16242239.227283565,9.966666666666667,11.508515365846542,0,0,897,651) as x, reg_hex_horiz_pixel_bin_y(conv_4326_900913_x(lon),-17552387.676773068,17552387.676773112,conv_4326_900913_y(lat),-9235139.541165564,16242239.227283565,9.966666666666667,11.508515365846542,0,0,897,651) as y, count(*) as color FROM tweets_nov_feb_60M WHERE ((lon >= -157.67578124999773 AND lon <= 157.67578124999812) AND (lat >= -63.54495286384991 AND lat <= 81.03987555989866)) GROUP BY x, y) as c
```

Then the following expression is used to ensure valid values to use for the domain:

`[max(mean - 2 * deviation, min), min(mean + 2 * deviation, max)]` 

Not only is this redundant, but can be expensive if the underlying binning query takes a while since that query would ultimately be run twice. With the advent of vega data transforms, this redundancy can be removed therefore speeding up the overall render time significantly.

Here's what the vega would now look like to make use of vega transforms instead:

```

With multi-layer maps need to allow/disallow crossfiltering on each layer,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3694,288674841,3694,,2018-01-15T17:55:43Z,2018-01-15T17:57:05Z,"As a user, I might want to make a map showing multiple longitude/latitude pairs from the same dataset (i.e. origin and destination on flights, pickup and dropoff locations on taxis). If we enforce cross-filtering on all layers in these situations we can get to the absurd situation where as I zoom in to an area, I crossfilter out all data. (Imagine zooming into SFO in the flights dataset showing both origin and destination on the same map). Since there are no flights that take off at SFO and land at SFO, I will filter out all of the data as I zoom in, which would be unexpected to the user.

I would suggest being able to turn on/off crossfiltering for each layer in the map. By default it would be on.

This would also bring our maps more in line with the behavior of our line charts and histograms, which do not filter if you zoom into a certain range (i.e. by filling in the min/max values). Ideally cross-filter on the current view would be a toggle for these charts as well to keep behavior consistent between the various charts in our app.",tmostak,enhancement,0,

Immerse should ensure that filter is the same type as the column.

As an example trip_distance < 30 and not trip_distance < 30.238238 because  the trip_distance filed is an INT.

If column is INT, the filter value should be INT and if column type is DECIMAL, the filter value should be DECIMAL with the same significant digits. 

Requested by Todd and needed for some performance improvement he did to reduce the memory size needed by group bys. And his fix only works if filter value is the same type as  column datatype.

It seems that we should document how the codebase is _generally_ structured and how 3rd party libraries are integrated so that new developers being on boarded have a guide for understanding the code, knowing where to look when it comes to various types of bugs, and so that there is knowledge sharing between developers who are already familiar with the code and those are not as familiar.

Perhaps a more pragmatic and temporary solution would be to have a Google Doc that serves as a basic outline of how everything fits together? 

I started one based on notes I took during a call with @biovisualize where he walked me through a good part of the code. Please feel free to comment on and add to it, but note that this is meant to be a resource for the Immerse front end team, not the general public, at least for now:

As a business decider, I want to track what features are used so I can make data-driven decisions. I need a central place to collect them that doesn't get me stuck in a specific app or workflow.

## Motivation
We already use Google Tag Manager (GTM) for stats in Google Analytics (GA). But We are limited in the number of custom dimensions, on data types and on analytics power. Also, we want to use this data in other tools (Salesforce, Immerse).

## Technical specs
We will evaluate [Segment](https://segment.com/) to collect the data in a db and pipe it to any analytics tools. Our tracking instrumentation in Immerse is generic enough that we could switch it to Segment (piping Segment to GA) or send data to both. But we also want to try instrumenting the code as a clean [Redux middleware](https://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html).

Maybe we have a box for the unit that gets added after the number.
In the picture as an example, as a user, I'd love to be able to see 99% instead of just 99.

then insert a row as follows:

INSERT INTO some_ints VALUES(4489949424181064562);

I discovered that if you change the name of the dashboard, then the save works.

I'm not sure why the Dashboard name has to change. Do dashboard names have to be unique across the server (or database)?
In any case Immerse should give a better error message if the name must be changed.

As a user, I want to be able to use the line chart without bugs slowing me down in my process of configuring and using it on a dashboard.

As a developer, I need a chart codebase that is easier to debug, scale and with less side-effects, so we can fix and develop new features quickly.

The line chart has a lot of associated bugs that should be addressed in batches instead of just fixing them one by one without fixing common causes. It also need to get more stable before adding new features. This is a placeholder task to collect all line chart bugs and features and sync on implementation.

## Acceptance criteria
This task can be closed when a group of issues has been fixed by fixing a common cause and the rest of the tasks are documented. It should not be a never-ending stream of tasks.",biovisualize,,9,

1. Create a dashboard with the contributions dataset
2. Create a new bar chart with `contributor gender` as a dimension, `amount` as a width
3. Save and exit
4. Return to chart, and switch to pointmap with `lat` and `lon`
5. Switch back to bar chart
6. Switch back to point map 

## Expected Result
Bar chart and pointmap render correctly (or require appropriate information for disparate chart types)

Currently, if 2 users working on the same dashboard in the same time, the last to save will overwrite the first user's edit.

For Example:
**Possible scenario:**
Users A & B editing the dashboard in the same time
User A: Add 2 charts and save
User B: Brush a chart and save

**Result:** User A's major edit will be replaced by user B's minor edit

**Suggested solutions:**
- We could allow notification when dashboard has an update from a different user
- Keep history log for changes made and offer ability to revert to any old edition and save
- Warn the user that saving could overwrite some changes

Line/Range Chart not properly updating when fetching additional data (rows) from server,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/3082,250437082,3082,,2017-08-15T20:58:33Z,2017-09-27T20:47:55Z,"## General Info

## Issue Description

There are two fundamental issues encountered here:

1) Line chart does not update automatically to latest data when loading a dashboard with new rows appended.
2) When brushing on areas of range chart where there is new data, focus chart does not reflect.

## Steps To Reproduce

Case 1: http://immerse-2759.dev.frontend.builds.mapd.com/
(Before line chart refactor)

- search `fake_oanda` and load that dashboard.
- You can see that as soon as the dashboard loads, both the focus chart and range chart update.
- You are also about to brush on range chart, and focus chart works!

Case 2: http://immerse-master.prod.frontend.builds.mapd.com/
(After line chart refactor)

- search `fake_oanda` and load that dashboard.
- You can see that as soon as the dashboard loads, range and focus chart DO NOT update until some kind of interaction occurs.  Eg. (clicking on focus chart, brushing on focus chart, etc.)
- You can also notice that brushing on range chart causes some odd in interactions.
(eg. It does not seem to recognize any data passed Feb 1st, 2002, 12:04AM)

## Issue Description
Currently, the bar cut off from the right side is based on the chart window. It should visually be based on the maximum x-axis. Looks like this is a side effect of the y-axis lock

## Steps To Reproduce
- Create a dashboard; contributions
- Make a valid bar chart
- D: committee_name, committee_party
- M: # Records
- Lock the maximum y-axis lock to 50,000

## Expected Result
- Crop of bars should be at the end of ruler of y-axis
- The values on the bars should be shifted to the end of bar

## Actual Result
- Crop of bars happen at the end of chart window
- Values on bars are chopped if bar is not completely showing on chart

## Issue Description
When Binning is off the charts should automatically adjust to the starting value in x axis, when the bins are set it works fine.

For example:
Data
X-axis : Years ranging from 1956-2016
Y-axis :  Values 0-2.2K

By just selecting the column values without specifying bins the X-axis values aren't getting adjusted to start from 1956.

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Select a flights table and create a dashboard.
2. Click on new chart and select line chart.
3. select Plane year in x-axis and Distance in Y-axis

## Expected Result
A horizontal line shouldn't get displayed which is a result of default adjustment to the starting value of year.

## Actual Result
The horizontal line should not be displayed. Charting should start from 1956

## Issue Description
When plotting year on x-axis, by default immerse shows short labels. This is good for numeric values but not for date parts like year. In the chart below every tick mark says 2.0K. Irrespective of whether binning is ON/OFF the years are shown in short form.

The issue is reproducible only if you have year as a separate INT column as in the example below. If you extract year from a proper date column, we do display the full year correctly.

This issue could be solved by allowing end user to specify the number format on axis, pop-up etc

## Steps To Reproduce

Create a line chart and use a year column as dimension and add any measure to the chart
## Expected Result

## Actual Result
The x-axis shows 2.0K as axis marks for all values, irrespective of binning ON/or OFF

Between SQL:2011 and SQL:2014, the following keywords were added:
ARRAY_MAX_CARDINALITY, BEGIN_FRAME, BEGIN_PARTITION, CLASSIFIER,
CURRENT_ROW, DEFINE, EMPTY, END_FRAME, END_PARTITION, FRAME_ROW, GROUPS,
INITIAL, MATCHES, MATCH_NUMBER, MATCH_RECOGNIZE, OMIT, ONE, PATTERN,
PER, PERCENT, PERIOD, PORTION, RUNNING, SEEK, SHOW, SKIP, SUBSET,
SYSTEM_TIME, VALUE_OF. All of these are now reserved in Calcite; some of
them were reserved already.

SQL:2014 removed: DAYS, FOREVER, HOURS, KEEP, MAX_CARDINALITY, MINUTES,
SECONDS. None of these were ever reserved in Calcite.

The following became reserved in SQL:2011, and are now reserved in
Calcite: LAG, LEAG, LIKE_REGEX, NTH_VALUE, NTILE, OCCURRENCES_REGEX,
POSITION_REGEX, SUBSTRING_REGEX, TRANSLATE_REGEX, TRIM_ARRAY, TRUNCATE,
VERSIONING.
```

This needs to be fixed because current datasets with these reserved keywords will get past the importer.

we also will need to make sure all customers with previously set column headers do not include any of these reserved keywords.

## Issue Description

### from customer:

Michael,

ref: attached image

Fangqiu Tu (the Verizon ookla analyst) requested that you provide a way to turn off the legend (and legend button) display in MapD.   He is giving a demo in 3 days, and needs to show the data currently being hidden by the hard-positioned legend-buttons.   If this is on your to-do list, then it might be a good investment of time, since Fangqiu is going to be demoing this to those at director level - which could be beneficial to everyone involved (i.e. Verizon, MapD, etc).

Details:

-----------------------------------

Fangqiu Tu (the data analyst working with the OOKLA data for Verizon competive evaluations), ask me if we could fast-track one of his issues (we discussed in the meeting).   It appears to have become more important because Fangqiu is preparing to give demos with these charts in 3 days.

Issue:

MapD Immerse visual control objects are hiding valuable parts of certain charts.   A specific example of this is the line charts in the attached image.   In one chart, the legend is hiding critical data points, but even worse, in the second chart the 'legend-button' (minimized legend) is hiding very critical points.   These points, ironically, are some of the most important parts of the graph.   There appears to be no work-around (like disable the control buttons, or move the controls around.).

 Fangqiu recommends that there be a way to turn of the legend & legend button. 

Comment:

Michael, I personally think this is part of a bigger issue associated with optimizing realestate on the dashboard.  It seems that Immerse, while nicer in appearance, uses large font and has a lot more white space that could be used by the charts.  The intent is to get more charts in one screen -  I do use zoom-out, but as we discussed, Immerse sometime gets confused about chart positions when you use zoom.

## Issue Description
Bug may hinge on first using a shortlink.  The bug is that dashboards issue queries to the wrong table in a narrow circumstance (see reproduction steps).

## Steps To Reproduce

5) watch the queries which are issued before Immerse throws its error

## Expected Result
dashboard loads up fine and queries are sensible

## Actual Result
dashboard throws error and the queries issued incorrectly try to hit the `contributions` table when the dashboard only deals with the `taxi_weather_tracts_factual` table. e.g. you can see ```SELECT COUNT(*) as val FROM contributions```

Exacerbating this issue is that we haven't namespaced any of our css classes or ids, which increases the risk of collisions. We should be prefixing with 'mapd-' at the minimum. Even better would be to have a notion of theme to support white labeling, so class name prefixes can also be parameterized to enable theme switching.

## Issue Description
Pie chart auto-bins to 10 bins, but the color palettes have only 9 colors.  The resulting pie has two adjacent slices with the same color, defeating the purpose of having colors.  Either auto-bin to 9, or add a color to the palette.

## Steps To Reproduce
Add a pie chart with default settings.

## Expected Result
No two adjacent pie slices use the same color.

## Actual Result
The first and last slice use the same color.

Migrate old dashboards for new Immerse versions,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/2493,219119941,2493,,2017-04-04T01:58:02Z,2017-08-07T18:47:29Z,"# User Story
As a user who created a dashboard with Immerse version X, I want to be able to open that dashboard with Immerse version Y (where Y > X).

# Specifications
- A ""migration"" is code that transforms dashboard saved data from the shape one version of Immerse expects to the shape another version of Immerse expects.
- [ ] Dash created on previous version of Immerse (eg v.1) can be opened on new version of Immerse (eg v.3) where there's a dash shape change.
- [ ] Dashes created on new version of Immerse (eg v.3) do *not* need to be able to work on *old* versions of Immerse (eg v.1) ie downgrading is not supported (tell customers to back up!).
- [ ] It's difficult or impossible for a dash shape change to be merged to master without including a corresponding migration.
- [ ] Do not need migrations for every version of Immerse.
- [ ] Migrations are transitive so given migrations `v.1 ➡️  v.2` and `v.2 ➡️ v.3`, a dash can migrate from v.1 ➡️ v.3.
- [ ] Only necessary migrations are run, so given migrations `v.1 ➡️  v.2` `v.2 ➡️ v.3` and `v.3 ➡️ v.4`, a dash can migrate from v.2 ➡️ v.4 without running `v.1 ➡️  v.2`.
- [ ] After migrating, dash is automatically saved. (Note there's a race here but it's okay as last save will overwrite.)

Maybe separate stories for these: -@mLuby  
- [ ] Dash shape data should be minimal. **`❗️NOTE THIS SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE ALL OTHERS❗️`** 
- [ ] With reduced dash shape, Immerse can fail gracefully on missing data, eg missing color still renders chart.
- [ ] Dash records either a version number or a hash of the dash so later on saves can decide whether to warn about overwriting.

# Notes
Now that [we record what Immerse version a dashboard was created with](https://github.com/map-d/mapd2-frontend/pull/2446), we’ll know if the shape of the saved dashboard’s data is different from the shape Immerse expects.

One solution is to write migration functions whenever we make breaking changes to the dashboard shape. These functions could be chained together to migrate arbitrarily old dashboards to the current version. It would also be a good idea development-wise to have some infrastructure/process to ensure breaking shape changes include the necessary migration.  ",mLuby,,2,
Inconsistent behavior with color-by-dimension on pie chart when drag/drop dimensions,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/2490,219000831,2490,,2017-04-03T17:10:42Z,2017-07-14T23:12:01Z,"## General Info

As a user, I would like to see my binned data in displayed in a user friendly way. For instance, when I choose to visualize a row chart selecting a time dimension extracted by `day`, I would like to see each bar labeled like ""Monday"", ""Tuesday"", ""Wednesday"", etc instead of ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", etc.

# Technical Specifications

* The core logic and functionality of `function unBinResults` in `modules/binning` should be moved to DC
* The core logic and functionality of `function fillBins` (around line 1505) should be moved to DC as well
* These post processing steps should be abstracted away inside a general data post-processing function invoked in `dataAsync`
* If possible, developer should separate the processing of time bin data and regular numerical bin data
* When possible, developer should clean up the code instead of just moving it

})

const customColorShape = shape({

#### Issues
- `customPalette` replicates a color constant
- `val` in both `regularColorShape` and `customColorShape` seems to be a replication of a color constant as well
- `isCustom` seems redundant since we already have a `type` called `custom`
- there should be one consistent color shape; something like

```js
const colorShape = shape({
  type: oneOf(),

  domain: arrayOf()
  range: arrayOf()

## Issue Description

Color is persistently broken in Immerse. One of the reason for this is color has a big and complicated feature set. And that the entire front-end team built it piece-meal over the course of a year, and without a full spec.

We should consolidate the code, and find a definitive code path to color charts, or else it will continue to be buggy and difficult to patch.

Refactor should preserve  - at least color by dimension versus color by measure even if we cannot keep the exact colors. Refactor should allow for color by dimension or color by measure where applicable. Today **Color by dimension** appears on the right side of the chart as visual customizations for a bar chart. However for line and histogram the exact same thing is exposed as **Series** on the left side of the chart as  data settings.

- Also ensure the default color palette for discrete colors (ordinal) is a palette of 10 or 12 and not 9 colors. 


And the first step to do this would be a code spec, based on this UX spec: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Us4kHgLt0pJbQg_wn5MW8NowFGYMsR2iNN98jk_M3q8

- **Platform**: All
- **Browser Name**: All
- **Browser Version**: All
- **Application Version**: master dev

## Issue Description
Haven't tested too in depth yet, but adding a timestamp column to a table results in the most recent row being filtered out. Example sql generated:

    SELECT
      a as key0,
      date_trunc(second, ts) as key1,
      COUNT(*) AS val
    FROM andrew_ts_bug
    WHERE
      (ts >= TIMESTAMP(0) '2017-01-09 14:40:01' AND
       ts < TIMESTAMP(0) '2017-01-09 14:40:03')
    GROUP BY key0, key1
    ORDER BY val
    DESC LIMIT 50
    OFFSET 400;

Generated sql is asking for `ts < max(ts)` instead of `ts <= max(ts)`.

## Steps To Reproduce
- On Kali, table `andrew_ts_bug`
- create table chart
- add column `a`. Note that there are `n` rows.
- add column `ts`, bin by seconds. Note that there are now only `n-1` rows shown, though the count in the top right says `n of n`.

I think in a case like this we'd expect to see something like a scatterplot condensed along one line.

Here's the query for the above screenshot:

```SELECT VoyageID as x,ZHeight as y,ships_ais.rowid FROM ships_ais WHERE (VoyageID >= -32767 AND VoyageID < 32767) AND (ZHeight >= 0 AND ZHeight < 0) LIMIT 2000000```

This query results in 0 returned rows because ZHeight >= 0 AND ZHeight < 0 will always return 0 rows. When the min/max are the same that query needs to be adjusted, probably to something like this `ZHeight >= 0 AND ZHeight <= 0`. This is a frontend issue.
