Currently importer creates a table, but does allow for appending for new rows.  

As a user, I would like to append additional records to an existing table via the importer.

**Verizon** has been asking for this feature for the last year or so as per @dwayneberry, and we have numerous other customers that would like this functionality.

The flow could be relatively simple:

from there -- the flow is almost the same.  The main difference is that `Row Append` will not provide is a `Table Preview` screen as it is likely not necessary.

----------------------------------------------------

**Some considerations to address:**

- [ ] Shape files (shp/kml/geojson) do not allow for row append.
- [ ] How will we handle the header of a `.csv/tsv`? do we need add an import option?

Have a look at the scatterplot below, where the dots represent NYC boroughs, and the x and y are average lon/lat.  The dots are forced together leading to a pretty useless chart, presumably because we're choosing lat and lon ranges for the axes based on universal min/max of lat/lon, rather than on the min/max lat/lon for the particular query being displayed by the chart (which is what we should do).

Create chart using boolean column.  Apply a filter, note you can enter any sort of expression, including arbitrary SQL statements.  Literal string true or false is accepted and works properly, as does selecting true or false from dropdown.  Entering a column name matches column.  Subquery works too, which seems potentially useful but inconsistent with other filter entry fields.

## Issue Description
Individual measure positions in the measures array can change unexpectedly. This is unexpected, and can causes problems when a measure was acceptable (by type, continuous/categorical, etc) in one position but not another.

My recommendation is that we take this opportunity to fix how we store measures; rather than as a list, we should be storing them according to their function ('x axis', 'color', 'size', etc). This will simplify logic that's scattered around that looks like `measures.filter(m => m.name === ""color"")` to `measures.color`. It will also reduce fragility (including this bug) caused by assuming measures in certain positions have certain meanings (eg [measure0, measure1] assuming measure1 means size). Finally, when we do actually want to iterate through the list of measures, we can do that easily with `Ramda.values(measures)`, and it will help separate the data from its view presentation.
## Steps To Reproduce
1.  [create pointmap](http://dashboard-v2-master.dev.frontend.builds.mapd.com/#/link/mapd/4c2c3aff) w lat, lon, and color (no size)
2. switch to heatmap (note that color measure was #4 measure is now #3)

On heatmap, color by a non-continuous measure is interpreted as ""Count Unique [measure]""

Given the work going on on https://github.com/map-d/mapd2/issues/353 we should have a good opportunity to unify this.  Would seem to me to make sense to have both be color by top n distinct values.

Parenthetical:
There are some fairly deep implications we'll have to think about here when we move to groupable pointmap.  Namely, that color-by-something will be able to bounce between: 1) color by continuous measure 2) color by non-continuous measure when not grouped 3) color by non-continuous dimension when grouped.  Avoiding user confusion across these will be require careful thinking (as we're already facing a confusing UX in color by dimension in pie chart for e.g.).

Could be particularly annoying if it was a big import.

Since our dialog box for this would be OK / Cancel, maybe message with a different verb like ""Abandon Data Import?"" instead of ""Cancel Data Import?"" would avoid confusion.

Longer term solution: perhaps it would be possible to have back and forward buttons work with each step of the import wizard rather than dropping you all the way back out to New Dashboard screen from deep in the wizard.  Ideally forward button would allow you to return into the columns/data type screen even if you had backed out of it.  Being able to do this and maintain state going back & forward would obviate the need for an OK / cancel confirmation.

Table aliases modal does not show `new` column. Column selectors show `undefined` where the new column should be.

To get around this, I had to manually modify `aliases` to get the desired results on our public flights demo.

Note: due to map-d/mapd2#189 (similar bug in the backend), you'll need to test against a non-calcite server or restart the calcite-enabled one after every `alter table`.

Frontend Cached Performance Observation,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/582,154126741,582,,2016-05-10T23:11:16Z,2017-07-16T06:24:18Z,"Not sure how to categorize this but wanted to record behaviour somewhere

Customer Verizon is having some slow performance due to backend query timings.

The customer was saying some queries occur fast and some occur slow.  Looking in the log all queries are repeatedly slow.

When using the dashboard it is clear that some 'refreshes' to the dashboard do appear to occur extremely quickly.

Talking to frontend dev it seems we have some code that caches calls to the DB and does NOT actually issue a new call to the backend for identical queries.

This explained the fast and ""normal"" speed queries

I have a slight concern around cached results in the frontend.  It means if I just sit repeatedly running same query I am not actually ever looking at new data in the actual database.  This could be very confusing and incorrect.

[Dashboard v2] Proof of Concept - Using Flow for Type Checking,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/475,151430312,475,,2016-04-27T16:30:57Z,2017-06-22T16:45:08Z,"A good first-step to see if Flow is something we would like to use would be to use it on one component, a util method, and a reducer. Perhaps this integration can ride with a pending or upcoming PR. 
#### Rationale

As our code base gets larger and more complex, some form of type-checking would be great to make the code base more manageable and bug free. 

Type checking would additionally give us some sort of documentation and testing at no extra cost.

We currently do a partial amount of type checking at the component level using `PropTypes`, but these checks only occur at runtime.

Flow type checking would catch type errors at compile time and can be used on utility functions, reducers, actions, etc.

`master` server handling is broken for demo mode,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/462,150765053,462,,2016-04-25T06:44:00Z,2016-08-01T20:52:53Z,"If no `master` server is set or the server that gets marked as master is unavailable, the `loadDashboard` option in `servers.json` breaks the frontend: the empty `Error!` message pops up, clicking on a recent dashboard causes everything to get stuck at the `Connecting` screen. Untested, but this may also affect the `share` link functionality.

Desired behavior: at a minimum, display useful error message explaining that the source of truth for the dashboards is not available.

Demo mode is a special case: you can assume that the saved dashboards have been manually replicated to all servers, so you can attempt to load the requested dashboard from any server.

Additionally, share links are deterministic with an acceptable collision probability, so you can safely blast `create_link` calls to all available servers (maybe prefer master first). When restoring from a shared link you can again attempt to restore from any server, not just the master.

(The backend issues this is working around will be resolved later this year once we have replication/HA.)

---

To reproduce and test: grab a [prebuilt backend](https://github.com/map-d/wiki/wiki/Download-URLs#backend) and run two instances of `mapd_web_server` on separate ports:

```
bin/mapd_web_server --backend-url ""http://kali.mapd.com:9092"" --port 10000
bin/mapd_web_server --backend-url ""http://kali.mapd.com:9092"" --port 11000
```

You can then access the frontend at http://localhost:10000 and http://localhost:11000 . For a custom frontend start with the flag `--frontend /path/to/dashboard-v1/public`.

Place the following `servers.json` in the `frontend` dir:

```
[
    {
        ""username"": ""mapd"",
        ""password"": ""HyperInteractive"",
        ""port"": 10000,
        ""host"": ""localhost"",
        ""database"": ""mapd"",
        ""master"": true,
        ""loadDashboard"": ""worldplanes""
    },
    {
        ""username"": ""mapd"",
        ""password"": ""HyperInteractive"",
        ""port"": 11000,
        ""host"": ""localhost"",
        ""database"": ""mapd"",
        ""master"": true,
        ""loadDashboard"": ""worldplanes""
    }
]
```

Play around with removing the `master` line and killing either of the servers. (Note: the last server listed as `master` is the one used for `masterCon`.)

Poor error handling if WebGL unavailable,https://github.com/mapd/mapd-immerse/issues/461,150732013,461,,2016-04-25T02:55:53Z,2017-12-01T17:34:54Z,"If WebGL is disabled or otherwise unavailable, v1 will only draw the boxes for each chart and then pop open an `Error!` message with no description about what happened. Console says `Failed to initialize WebGL`, but nothing useful is directly shown to the user. Since all charts fail to draw, the frontend appears broken.

What should happen: only the chart which requires WebGL should fail to draw (and display a friendly message explaining the situation). Missing WebGL should not break everything.

To test: recent versions of Chrome require an extension to disable; Firefox has a flag in `about:config`.

`mapd.js` and `mapdcon.js` are currently hard-coded to use HTTP (see eg [mapd.js:1203](https://github.com/map-d/mapd2-frontend/blob/da8b2c3af8761f4ab5288989f8ba2d4a88921f73/main/source/js/mapd.js#L1203)).

The quick fix would be to use protocol-relative links (see below), however this will fail if the frontend is not served under the same protocol as the backend. (ignoring cross-protocol warnings)

Current: `url: ""http://"" + server.host + "":"" + server.port,`
Protocol-less: `url: ""//"" + server.host + "":"" + server.port,`

Permanent fix would be to include the protocol in `servers.json`. To make life simpler, create an `endpoint` var/getter fn and use this everywhere instead of manually building it up each time. e.g. `con.getEndpoint()` vs `""http://"" + con.getHost() + "":"" + con.getPort()`
