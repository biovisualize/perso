Able to repro. Am looking into this now. ,alexbaden
I can't find the issue, but this is directly related to the color scale not behaving properly in these raster charts.

When reproing, note that on the second layer the color palette shows as a single color, when in fact it should be quantitative (since density accumulation is turned on). Similarly, when selecting choropleth first, then pointmap in the chart editor, the color scale on pointmap will remain solid color when it should be quantitative (for density accumulation).,alexbaden"

Adds `TypeScript` to our build, allowing new code to be written in typescript.

* Converts all `@flow` to `.ts`/`.tsx` files
* Adds support to `typescript` test files
* Adds `tslint` 
* Adds types for most common libraries (React, Redux, react-redux, react-router, chai, redux-saga, mocha)



### 📄 Github Issue
Closes #4713

Points of Discusssion
* What `tslint` rules do we want to apply?
* Perf benchmarks (how much slower is the compiler)
* Practices and standards for interop between old `js` files with new `ts` files (I'm planning on identifying the potential pain points 
* Using relative paths for everything (I had issues with custom resolutions for modules and had to change some of the paths in `.ts` files to be relative since they could not resolve).

Future Goals:
* Migrate our other `js` libraries (`connector`, `charting`) to typescript to support interfaces between libraries",jmenestr,tech,,"**Immerse**: http://immerse-4732.dev.frontend.builds.mapd.com

@jmenestr I'm not sure if your plan is to eventually merge this PR, but if so I would recommend not altering the files relating to the geo charts as I believe they're being actively worked on by @alexbaden for future releases. Or at perhaps check in with him if you do so.,clhenrick
@clhenrick I'll coordinate with him. The reason I changed them over to `.ts` is because I switched for using `ts-loader` to `awesome-ts-loader`, and the latter was having issues with the type declarations in a `.js` file.

I was having general issues with impots with `ts-loader`. 

I'll see what I can do.,jmenestr

A list of widgets coming from Immerse, preferably with screenshots, stored someplace accessible and easy to modify (such as the wiki at https://mapdgpu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FE/overview).

### Start of a list
* Error modal
* tooltips
* Dropdown
* Form widgets (checkbox/togle)",biovisualize,"components,design",,
[UI Components] Components library,4715,,2018-06-12T21:09:00Z,2018-06-13T13:08:42Z,"### Description
Move to a documented UI library or at least patterns.

### User story

### Acceptance criteria

### Goals
* Document the design patterns
* Hand-off design to implementation
* Force to decouple the code into modular components with clear interfaces and sane relation with the UI part of it

### Steps
* Make an inventory of the widgets we have and the constraints attached to them
* List the UI goals (accessibility)
* Identify how to get started

### Find a project as a pretext to get started:
* Formatting UI
* Admin UI
* Error modals
* Notifications
* Low-hanging fruits like button colors and components that are already stock, like some autocomplete dropdowns, tooltips
* Responsiveness is a project that is too big, but maybe doing it for a view, like Dataset or SQL Editor

### Constraints from the tech side
* We don't often have new views or components to introduce, so we need to be proactive in reworking our existing components for any project
* We have a lot of custom components, sometimes it's just a normal component with deep coupling in the rest of the code, but sometimes it's because the widgets are very complicated, contextual or just plain weird.",biovisualize,"Design System,Epic,components",Christian-Baptiste,"Here are a couple examples of design systems to modal after:

Adding Typescript to Immersere,4712,,2018-06-12T20:18:59Z,2018-06-13T20:20:14Z,"Context: 
As the immerse codebase grows, and we strive towards reliability and predictability, we need better tools for scaling the code. Introducing new static analysis will do a few things to help us reach these goals

1) Allows developers to focus on exposed APIs, and use tooling to consume those APIs (no need to know the code base by memory)
* Types exists for libraries we depend greatly on ([crossfilter.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/crossfilter), [dc.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/dc)), which we can consume in our `connector` and `charting` libraries for cleaner, more maintainable interfaces with immerse
2) Time saved fixing bugs is time gained writing features
* `Typescript` tooling is fantastic. It will help prevent interface bugs before production, and since tooling can read and understand `typescript` interfaces, more time is spent just writing new code rather than always having to look up types and data contracts

By integration all our libraries together with `typescript`, we gain faster developer speed (more features) and better documentation that remains in sync with the code. 

Goal:
Incrementally add typescript to the `immerse` platform in such a way that
1) New `.ts(x)` files can live with existing `.js(x)` files
2) existing type systems (`flow`) are removed and migrated over to typescript

@biovisualize I think the point of this one is not to track ongoing Typescript inclusion, we haven't scoped that much yet. The deliverables are #4713 and #4714, and pretty small and measurable.,jrajav
Very much onboard with this idea! I have used typescript on complex
projects in the past and it is a great tool for reducing runtime errors and
improving code readability.

Chris V makes a good point. Perhaps a good place to start is crossfilter /
the data layer? I find that’s the most opaque part of immerse, and
improving that API would help our clients who have custom frontend tools as
well.

To that point though, we should probably more explicitly scope this down to just those two and call it closed when finished. @jmenestr if you agree can we please title this epic more like 'beginning' or 'initial' inclusion to Immerse?,jrajav
I feel like we'll know the epic is done when it's associated stories are also done, but adding acceptance criteria would be a way specify the deliverables ,jmenestr
@alexbaden @jrajav @biovisualize 

I'll decrease the scope of this particular epic, but if this isn't done when we get jira, I'd like an over-aching epic that does encompass adding `typescript` to all our `js` libraries and use that as a tracker that can span repos. The unfortunate con with GitHub is that the epic is only related tone repo,jmenestr"

Clean up raster chart functionality,4706,,2018-06-12T13:51:04Z,2018-06-12T13:53:46Z,"Master issue to investigate raster chart (pointmap, geoheat, choropleth) functionality as relating to selectors (dimensions, measures), automatic logic around geo columns, and anything else that can be consolidated, shared, or made more robust.

* Ensure that x, y (lon, lat) columns are treated specially in a robustly stored or referenced way - in many parts of the code now, they are just assumed to be index 0 and 1 in the measures.

Other notes from Slack:
* Cleaning up the dimension shenanigans
* Removing all references to “geoheat” that don’t reference a heatmap
* Unifying raster chart actions and using thunk
* Or sagas or some such to dispatch appropriate functions?",jrajav,tech,,

When selecting a dimension on pointmap, the popup columns are set to the static set of columns defined in the aggregate and the popup column configuration is hidden. However, if one selects some custom popup columns before selecting the dimension, only that set is shown. Need to clear the popup columns back to the default before setting the static set.

If the user selects a dimension but not a join, the color measure will default to group by. This is problematic if no join is used, since the group. Not sure what the right approach is, but some combination of better design and helpful error messages will likely be needed.

Null values remain excluded from charts after a filter is cleared from Scatter chart ,4699,,2018-06-12T02:27:07Z,2018-06-12T15:59:23Z,"### :speech_balloon: Description
When you apply a filter on the scatter chart it will remove NULL from all charts. Even after the filter is removed the values will not be displayed until the Scatter chart is deleted. 

### :computer: Environment
- **Browser Chrome, 67.0.3396.79**: 
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master

### :page_with_curl: Steps To Reproduce
- Create a Table chart (Source: flights | Dimension: airtime)
- Create a Scatter chart ( Source: flights | Dimension X Axis: airtime | Dimension Y Axis: distance)
- Apply a filter on the Scatter chart by zooming in/out or selecting an area with the tooltip
- Clear the filter from the Scatter chart or clear all filters
- Delete the Scatter chart 

- **Actual result:**
The Scatter chart automatically excludes NULL from all charts when a filter is applied to it and does not return the NULL values after the filter is cleared. 
- **Expected result:**
NULL should not be removed from other charts when a filter is applied to Scatter chart. If NULL values are filtered out according to the filter on the Scatter chart, they should return when the filter is removed.
