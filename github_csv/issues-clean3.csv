Adds `TypeScript` to our build, allowing new code to be written in typescript.

* Converts all `@flow` to `.ts`/`.tsx` files

* Adds `tslint` 
* Adds types for most common libraries (React, Redux, react-redux, react-router, chai, redux-saga, mocha)



### 📄 Github Issue
Closes #4713

Points of Discusssion
* What `tslint` rules do we want to apply?
* Perf benchmarks (how much slower is the compiler)
* Practices and standards for interop between old `js` files with new `ts` files (I'm planning on identifying the potential pain points 
* Using relative paths for everything (I had issues with custom resolutions for modules and had to change some of the paths in `.ts` files to be relative since they could not resolve).

Future Goals:
* Migrate our other `js` libraries (`connector`, `charting`) to typescript to support interfaces between libraries","jmenestr","tech",

### Acceptance criteria

### Goals
* Document the design patterns
* Hand-off design to implementation
* Force to decouple the code into modular components with clear interfaces and sane relation with the UI part of it

### Steps
* Make an inventory of the widgets we have and the constraints attached to them
* List the UI goals (accessibility)
* Identify how to get started

### Find a project as a pretext to get started:
* Formatting UI
* Admin UI
* Error modals
* Notifications
* Low-hanging fruits like button colors and components that are already stock, like some autocomplete dropdowns, tooltips
* Responsiveness is a project that is too big, but maybe doing it for a view, like Dataset or SQL Editor

### Constraints from the tech side
* We don't often have new views or components to introduce, so we need to be proactive in reworking our existing components for any project
* We have a lot of custom components, sometimes it's just a normal component with deep coupling in the rest of the code, but sometimes it's because the widgets are very complicated, contextual or just plain weird.","biovisualize","Design System,Epic,components","Christian-Baptiste"

"Adding Typescript to Immersere",4712,,"2018-06-12T20:18:59Z","2018-06-13T20:20:14Z","Context: 
As the immerse codebase grows, and we strive towards reliability and predictability, we need better tools for scaling the code. Introducing new static analysis will do a few things to help us reach these goals

1) Allows developers to focus on exposed APIs, and use tooling to consume those APIs (no need to know the code base by memory)
* Types exists for libraries we depend greatly on ([crossfilter.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/crossfilter), [dc.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/dc)), which we can consume in our `connector` and `charting` libraries for cleaner, more maintainable interfaces with immerse
2) Time saved fixing bugs is time gained writing features
* `Typescript` tooling is fantastic. It will help prevent interface bugs before production, and since tooling can read and understand `typescript` interfaces, more time is spent just writing new code rather than always having to look up types and data contracts

By integration all our libraries together with `typescript`, we gain faster developer speed (more features) and better documentation that remains in sync with the code. 

Goal:
Incrementally add typescript to the `immerse` platform in such a way that
1) New `.ts(x)` files can live with existing `.js(x)` files
2) existing type systems (`flow`) are removed and migrated over to typescript

"issue with null domain after switching between raster charts",4702,,"2018-06-12T04:14:10Z","2018-06-12T04:14:10Z","### :speech_balloon: Description

Sometimes the raster chart domain will appear as ""null"" when switching between raster charts before saving. Am having a difficult time reproing, but suspect it might have something to do with handling autoscaling properly on a raster chart switch.

"better dimension handling in choropleth",4701,,"2018-06-12T03:31:40Z","2018-06-13T00:00:38Z","### :speech_balloon: Description

If the user selects a dimension but not a join, the color measure will default to group by. This is problematic if no join is used, since the group. Not sure what the right approach is, but some combination of better design and helpful error messages will likely be needed.

"Null values remain excluded from charts after a filter is cleared from Scatter chart ",4699,,"2018-06-12T02:27:07Z","2018-06-12T15:59:23Z","### :speech_balloon: Description
When you apply a filter on the scatter chart it will remove NULL from all charts. Even after the filter is removed the values will not be displayed until the Scatter chart is deleted. 

### :computer: Environment
- **Browser Chrome, 67.0.3396.79**: 
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master

### :page_with_curl: Steps To Reproduce
- Create a Table chart (Source: flights | Dimension: airtime)
- Create a Scatter chart ( Source: flights | Dimension X Axis: airtime | Dimension Y Axis: distance)
- Apply a filter on the Scatter chart by zooming in/out or selecting an area with the tooltip
- Clear the filter from the Scatter chart or clear all filters
- Delete the Scatter chart 

- **Actual result:**
The Scatter chart automatically excludes NULL from all charts when a filter is applied to it and does not return the NULL values after the filter is cleared. 
- **Expected result:**
NULL should not be removed from other charts when a filter is applied to Scatter chart. If NULL values are filtered out according to the filter on the Scatter chart, they should return when the filter is removed.

"Heat chart unable to render certain strings in a particular dataset",4698,,"2018-06-12T01:21:34Z","2018-06-12T01:23:52Z","### :speech_balloon: Description
Encountered an issue during regression with a particular dataset and Heat chart (all string values). The culprit seems to be the 'network_location' column. 

### :computer: Environment
- **Browser Chrome, 67.0.3396.79**: 
- **mapd-immerse Version or Branch**: master

### :page_with_curl: Steps To Reproduce
- Create a Heat chart using dataset 'ga_sourcemedium' located on kali. 
Dimension X Axis: browser_size
Dimension Y Axis: network_location
Measure Color: browser_size 

- **Actual result:**
The chart doesn't render, but no error message is generated and errors don't appear in the console. After some time the fields no longer respond to clear. 
- **Expected result:**
An error should be generated if an invalid column is used and gets highlighted in red in the field it was selected in, or the Heatchart renders if there are no issues with the data.
