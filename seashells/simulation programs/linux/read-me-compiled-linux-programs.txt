Running the programs under Linux without compilation:
=====================================================

If you don't want to install the FreeBasic compiler for Linux but you like to run programs: 
this directory contains Linux-compiled versions.

The programs oliva, pattern and e-coli can be started directly since they do not 
need parameters (the source files are in the directory demo). 

sp and xy have first to be copied into the next-lower directory 
(where also the Windows-.exe files are located).
This is in order that the program finds the paramter files.
